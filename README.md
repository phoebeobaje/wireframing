# wireframing
## Introduction 
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process that involves creating low-fidelity visual representations of a website, application, or interface. These simplified sketches or layouts focus on structure and functionality rather than design details like color, typography, or graphics.
## Why Wireframing is Important
- **Clarifies Structure**: Wireframes help designers and stakeholders understand the page layout and information hierarchy.
- **Encourages Feedback Early**: Stakeholders can review and provide input on functionality and flow before development begins.
- **Saves Time and Costs**: Identifying issues at the wireframe stage prevents expensive changes later in the development process.
- **Facilitates Collaboration**: Designers, developers, and clients can align on expectations and usability from the start.
